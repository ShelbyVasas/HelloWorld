# Overview

This project is a basic landing page for me to test correct software implementation on my machine and prepare my environment for future projects.

This is a simple Hello World project written in c#.

This software was a simple reminder of how to properly set up a file in my IDE in the C# language and properly use git commands to publish the software on GitHub.
